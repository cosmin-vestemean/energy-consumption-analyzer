## What the Application Does

### 1. **Data Analysis**

Your hourly/daily energy consumption data is analyzed to calculate:

- **Total Consumption**: Sum of all energy used over the period
- **Average Usage**: Mean consumption per hour and per day
- **Peak Demand**: Maximum power requirement (important for system sizing)
- **Usage Patterns**: When you use most electricity (peak vs. off-peak hours)
- **Consumption Variability**: How consistent or variable your usage is

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**

The application identifies:

- **Peak Hours**: Times of day with highest consumption (typically 10 AM - 7 PM)
- **Off-Peak Hours**: Low consumption periods (midnight - 6 AM, 10 PM - 11 PM)
- **Load Factor**: How efficiently you use energy (higher = more consistent)
- **Consumption Distribution**: Breakdown of usage levels (0-1 kWh, 1-5 kWh, etc.)

### 3. **Solar System Recommendations**

Based on your consumption, the system calculates:

- **Required Solar Panel Capacity** (in kW)
- **Number of Solar Panels** needed (default: 415W panels, configurable 250-700W)
- **Battery Storage Size** (for backup power, configurable autonomy days)
- **Inverter Size** (to handle peak loads)
- **Estimated Costs** (equipment + installation)
- **Expected Savings** and payback period

> **v2.0 Update:** All parameters are now configurable! See the PV Configuration Panel in the app for customization options based on [E.ON Romania data](https://www.eon-energie.ro/ro/pentru-acasa/articole-utile/consum-energetic/articole-legate-de-consum/cate-panouri-fotovoltaice-sunt-necesare-unei-case-din-romania.html).

## Key Formulas Explained (in Plain English)

### Solar Panel Sizing

**How many solar panels do you need?**

```
Step 1: Calculate your daily energy need
        ‚Üí Average all your daily consumption values

Step 2: Calculate required solar capacity
        ‚Üí Daily need √∑ 4.5 hours of sunlight √∑ 85% efficiency
        ‚Üí This accounts for losses in the system

Step 3: Calculate number of panels
        ‚Üí Required capacity √∑ 400 watts per panel
        ‚Üí Round up to whole number
```

**Example:**
- Daily consumption: 30 kWh
- Required capacity: 30 √∑ 4.5 √∑ 0.85 = 7.84 kW
- Number of panels: 7,840 watts √∑ 400 watts = **20 panels**

### Battery Storage Sizing

**How much battery capacity do you need?**

```
Battery size = (Daily energy need √ó 2 days backup) √∑ 90% efficiency

The "2 days" provides reserve power for cloudy weather
The 90% accounts for charging/discharging losses
```

**Example:**
- Daily consumption: 30 kWh
- Battery size: (30 √ó 2) √∑ 0.9 = **66.7 kWh**

### Inverter Sizing

**What size inverter do you need?**

```
Inverter size = Peak power consumption √ó 1.2

The 1.2 factor (20% extra) handles surge loads
(like when multiple appliances start at once)
```

**Example:**
- Peak consumption: 5 kW
- Inverter size: 5 √ó 1.2 = **6 kW**

### Cost Calculations

**How much will the system cost?**

```
Equipment Costs (using configurable parameters):
- Solar panels: Number of panels √ó Panel Wattage √ó Price per Watt
  (Default: 415W panels @ configurable RON/watt)
- Battery: Capacity in kWh √ó Battery Cost per kWh (configurable)
- Inverter: Size in kW √ó Inverter Cost per kW (configurable)

Total Cost = Equipment Cost √ó Installation Multiplier (default: 1.3)
(The 1.3 adds 30% for installation, wiring, mounting, etc.)
```

**Example System Cost (using default 415W panels):**
- 19 panels: 19 √ó 415W = 7,885W capacity
- Battery and inverter: sized according to configurable parameters
- **Total calculated based on current market rates**

> **Note:** Exact costs depend on your configured parameters. Use the PV Configuration Panel to adjust prices based on your local market.

### Payback Period

**How long until the system pays for itself?**

```
Annual savings = Daily consumption √ó 365 days √ó Electricity Rate (RON/kWh)
Payback period = Total system cost √∑ Annual savings

Default: 0.80 RON/kWh (configurable range: 0.40-1.50 RON/kWh)
```

**Example (using default 0.80 RON/kWh):**
- Daily usage: 30 kWh
- Annual savings: 30 √ó 365 √ó 0.80 = 8,760 RON/year
- Payback: Total system cost √∑ 8,760 RON = **Payback period (years)**

> **Tip:** Adjust the electricity rate in the configuration panel to match your actual utility costs for accurate payback calculations.

## Three System Options

The application recommends three different system sizes:

### üîµ Conservative System (80% Coverage)

- **Goal**: Cover 80% of energy needs
- **Cost**: Lowest (75% of optimal)
- **Best for**: Budget-conscious, reliable grid available
- **Trade-off**: Still need grid power regularly

### üü¢ Optimal System (100% Coverage)

- **Goal**: Cover 100% of average energy needs
- **Cost**: Moderate (baseline)
- **Best for**: Maximum self-sufficiency, typical residential
- **Trade-off**: Balanced approach

### üü† Aggressive System (130% Coverage)

- **Goal**: Oversized for future needs
- **Cost**: Highest (140% of optimal)
- **Best for**: Future EV charging, system expansion, off-grid
- **Trade-off**: Higher upfront cost

## Understanding Your Analysis Results

### Load Factor

**What it means:**
- **High (>70%)**: You use energy consistently throughout the day (efficient)
- **Medium (40-70%)**: Normal residential pattern with some peaks
- **Low (<40%)**: High variability, significant peak demands

**Why it matters:**
A higher load factor means your solar system will be used more efficiently.

### Peak-to-Off-Peak Ratio

**What it means:**
- **High (>5)**: Most usage during daytime (ideal for solar!)
- **Medium (2-5)**: Normal residential pattern
- **Low (<2)**: Heavy evening/night usage (need larger battery)

**Why it matters:**
Higher ratios mean solar panels will directly meet most of your demand.

### Coefficient of Variation

**What it means:**
- **High (>100%)**: Very unpredictable usage
- **Medium (50-100%)**: Moderate variability
- **Low (<50%)**: Consistent, predictable usage

**Why it matters:**
Lower variation allows for more precise system sizing and better efficiency.
