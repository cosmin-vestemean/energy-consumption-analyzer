# Encoding Fix Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** UTF-8 character encoding corruption in documentation HTML files

## Problem Description

The documentation HTML files in `/public/docs/` contained corrupted UTF-8 characters that appeared as garbled text in the browser:

### Examples of Corrupted Characters:
- `Ôťů` instead of `✓` (checkmark)
- `ÔéČ` instead of `€` (Euro symbol)
- `├Ś` instead of `×` (multiplication sign)
- `├Ě` instead of `÷` (division sign)
- `Ôîł` and `Ôîë` instead of `⌈` and `⌉` (ceiling brackets)
- `¤â` instead of `σ` (sigma)
- `╬╝` instead of `μ` (mu)

### Example of Corrupted Text:
```
Daily usage: 30 kWh
Annual savings: 30 ├Ś 365 ├Ś 0.25 = ÔéČ2,738/year
Payback: ÔéČ45,344 ├Ě ÔéČ2,738 = 16.6 years
```

## Solution

Created and executed an encoding fix script that:

1. **Identified all corrupted character patterns** in the HTML files
2. **Mapped them to correct UTF-8 symbols** using a replacement dictionary
3. **Processed all 5 documentation files**:
   - `client-summary.html`
   - `quick-reference.html`
   - `technical-formulas.html`
   - `data-processing.html`
   - `pv-configuration.html`
4. **Preserved file structure** and formatting while fixing only the encoding

## Character Mapping Applied

```javascript
const encodingFixes = {
  'Ôťů': '✓',
  'ÔéČ': '€',
  '├Ś': '×',
  '├Ě': '÷',
  'Ôîł': '⌈',
  'Ôîë': '⌉',
  '¤â': 'σ',
  '╬╝': 'μ',
};
```

## Result

All documentation files now display correctly with proper UTF-8 characters:

### Fixed Example:
```
Daily usage: 30 kWh
Annual savings: 30 × 365 × 0.25 = €2,738/year
Payback: €45,344 ÷ €2,738 = 16.6 years
```

### Verification:
- ✓ All 5 HTML files updated successfully
- ✓ Build process completed without errors
- ✓ Encoding preserved in `/dist/` folder
- ✓ Characters display correctly in browser

## Files Modified

```
public/docs/
├── client-summary.html      ✓ Fixed
├── quick-reference.html     ✓ Fixed
├── technical-formulas.html  ✓ Fixed
├── data-processing.html     ✓ Fixed
└── pv-configuration.html    ✓ Fixed
```

## Technical Notes

- **Root Cause:** The original conversion script (`update-docs-style.js`) did not explicitly handle UTF-8 encoding
- **Fix Method:** Character-by-character replacement using a mapping dictionary
- **File Operations:** Read with UTF-8 encoding, process, write with UTF-8 encoding
- **Verification:** Grep search and visual inspection of built files

## Next Steps

- ✅ Encoding issues resolved
- ✅ Build verified successful
- ✅ Ready for deployment
- Consider updating `update-docs-style.js` to include encoding fix for future conversions

*This fix ensures all mathematical formulas, currency symbols, and special characters display correctly across all documentation pages.*
