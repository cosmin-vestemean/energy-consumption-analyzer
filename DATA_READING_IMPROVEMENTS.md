# Data Reading Improvements - Excel File Processing

## Overview
Updated the application to ensure **ALL data** from Excel files (hourly/daily consumption for a full year) is properly read and processed.

## Changes Made

### 1. FileUpload Component (`src/components/FileUpload.jsx`)
**Improvements:**
- âœ… Removed the filter that excluded zero-consumption values
- âœ… Added comprehensive validation for data ranges
  - Energy values: Must be >= 0 (allows zero consumption)
  - Hour values: 0-23 range validation
  - Day values: 1-31 range validation
  - Month values: 1-12 range validation
- âœ… Better handling of missing or null values
- âœ… Only filters out rows with missing **required** fields or invalid ranges
- âœ… Enhanced logging to show total rows processed and sample data (first 5 and last 5 rows)

**Before:** Filtered out rows where `energie <= 0`, potentially losing valid data
**After:** Keeps all valid data points including zero consumption

### 2. ConsumptionAnalysis Component (`src/components/ConsumptionAnalysis.jsx`)
**Improvements:**
- âœ… Smart data aggregation for large datasets
  - If > 1000 data points: Aggregates to **daily averages** for better visualization
  - If <= 1000 data points: Shows all **hourly data**
- âœ… Increased scatter plot limit from 500 to 1000 points
- âœ… Time series chart now adapts based on dataset size
- âœ… Proper sorting and labeling of aggregated data

**Benefits:**
- Can handle full year of hourly data (8,760 data points)
- Maintains performance with large datasets
- Better visualization without losing data insights

### 3. EnergyDashboard Component (`src/components/EnergyDashboard.jsx`)
**Improvements:**
- âœ… Added comprehensive data coverage banner showing:
  - Total number of readings
  - Number of unique days covered
  - Number of unique months covered
  - Percentage coverage of a full year
  - Date range (min/max dates)
- âœ… Visual feedback to user about data completeness

### 4. EnergyDashboard CSS (`src/components/EnergyDashboard.css`)
**Improvements:**
- âœ… Added styling for the new data info banner
- âœ… Clean, informative design with gradient background

## Expected Data Format

### For Full Year Coverage:
- **Hourly data:** 8,760 rows (365 days Ã— 24 hours)
- **Daily data:** 365 rows (1 row per day)
- **Columns:** energie (kwh), ora (hour), zi (day), luna (month)

### Data Validation:
```javascript
âœ… energie >= 0 (includes zero values)
âœ… ora: 0-23 (hour of day)
âœ… zi: 1-31 (day of month)
âœ… luna: 1-12 (month)
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Capture:** All valid data points are now processed
2. **Zero Consumption Handling:** Zero values are retained (important for nighttime readings)
3. **Scalability:** Handles datasets from a few days to multiple years
4. **Performance:** Smart aggregation prevents UI slowdown
5. **Transparency:** Users can see exactly how much data was loaded
6. **Accurate Analysis:** All calculations use the complete dataset

## Testing

Upload an Excel file with hourly consumption data and verify:
1. âœ… Console shows: "Processed X rows of data"
2. âœ… Dashboard banner shows data coverage percentage
3. âœ… All charts display properly with the full dataset
4. âœ… Zero consumption values are included
5. âœ… Analysis calculations are accurate

## Sample Console Output
```
Processed 8760 rows of data
First 5 rows: [...]
Last 5 rows: [...]
```

## Dashboard Banner Example
```
ðŸ“… Data Coverage: 8760 readings (365 days, 12 months) - 100% of full year
Period: 1/1/2024 - 12/31/2024
```
