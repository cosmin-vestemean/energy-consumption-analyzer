## üìä Key Formulas Summary

### Solar Panel Sizing
```
PV Capacity (kW) = Daily Consumption √∑ 4.5 hours √∑ 0.85
Number of Panels = Capacity √ó 1000 √∑ 400W (round up)
```

### Battery Sizing
```
Battery (kWh) = Daily Consumption √ó 2 days √∑ 0.9
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Total Cost = (Panel + Battery + Inverter) √ó 1.3
```

### Payback Period
```
Payback = Total Cost √∑ (Daily kWh √ó 365 √ó ‚Ç¨0.25/kWh)
```
