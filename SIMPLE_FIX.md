# FINAL FIX: Documentation Hub on Heroku

## The Real Problem
We overcomplicated it! The `-s` flag was breaking static HTML files.

## The Simple Solution
**Just remove the `-s` flag from the Procfile.**

### Before (BROKEN):
```
web: npx serve -s dist -p $PORT
```

### After (WORKS):
```
web: npx serve dist -p $PORT
```

## Why This Works

Your app doesn't use React Router, so it doesn't need the `-s` (single-page-app) flag.

Without `-s`:
- ✅ `/` → serves `dist/index.html` (your main app)
- ✅ `/docs/index.html` → serves `dist/docs/index.html` (documentation hub)
- ✅ `/docs/client-summary.html` → serves `dist/docs/client-summary.html` (doc page)
- ✅ All static files served correctly

With `-s` (the problem):
- ❌ `/docs/client-summary.html` → rewrites to `/index.html` (WRONG!)
- ❌ Any route → rewrites to `/index.html`

## Files Changed
1. ✅ `Procfile` - Removed `-s` flag
2. ✅ `App.jsx` - Already using absolute URLs (good practice)
3. ❌ Deleted `serve.json` - Not needed!
4. ❌ Deleted `server.js` - Not needed!

## Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove -s flag to allow static HTML docs"
git push heroku main
```

## Test Locally
```bash
npm run build
npx serve dist -p 5000
```

Then test:
- http://localhost:5000 → Main app ✅
- http://localhost:5000/docs/index.html → Documentation hub ✅
- Click any documentation card → Should load the HTML page ✅
